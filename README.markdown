Riik
====

Lightweight object mapper for Riak.

Motivation
==========

Riik doesn't support everything you would exepct from a full ORM.  There
are no validations, no callbacks, etc,.  as the primary motivation was
providing an extremely thin abstraction over RObject allowing you to map
classes and object to serialized keys.  The benefits come from being
able to work with a lightweight abstraction without dependencies on
larger, external gems, such as activesupport and activemodel.

If you're building an entire site with Riak as the primary data store,
you should be looking at [Ripple]{https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple}.

Usage 
=====

Specify a class and include the object mapper mixin.  Then, specify the
argument list for the initialize method.

```ruby 
class Person
  include Riik::Document
  initializes_with :first_name, :last_name
end

```

Then, use it!

```ruby 
Person.find('this-key-name')  # => #<Person.. @first_name="Fat", @last_name="Mike">
p = Person.new('Fat', 'Mike') # => #<Person.. @first_name="Fat", @last_name="Mike">
p.save # => true
```

Customization 
=============

See ```lib/riik.rb``` for more information.

All of the model attributes are available as a Hash in ```attributes```.

Want to change the way the key is generated?  Override ```default_key``` in your
class.

```ruby 
def default_key 
  Base64::encode(attributes)
end
```

Want to change the content type?  Override ```content-type``` in your
class.

```ruby 
def content_type 
  "application/xml"
end
```

Want to change the bucket?  Override ```bucket``` in your
class.

```ruby 
def bucket
  "best-things"
end
```

Want to change the client?  Override ```client``` in your
class.

```ruby 
def client
  Riak::Client.new(:protocol => "pbc")
end
```

You can also change these attributes per instance!
